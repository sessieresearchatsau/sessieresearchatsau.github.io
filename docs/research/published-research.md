## Papers
- [An Improved Generalized Enumeration of Substitution Systems by Kenneth E. Caviness, Camille Morrow, Christen Case and Victoria Kratzke](https://www.complex-systems.com/abstracts/v29_i04_a04/)
    _(The current enumeration used for all substitution system rulesets)_
- [Indexed Concatenation Notation: A Novel Way to Summarize Networks and Other Complex Systems by Kenneth Caviness, Colton Davis, Derek Renck, Charles Sarr, Scot Anderson, Heaven Robles and Rhys Sharpe](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2025/135147/135147.pdf)
    _(Introduction of a new notation that allows recognition of SSS causal networks, and much more)_
- [Indexing Strings and Rulesets « The Mathematica Journal](https://www.mathematica-journal.com/2011/05/11/indexing-strings-and-rulesets/)
    _(Development of enumerations for all strings, all string lists, and a first attempt at an enumeration of all SSS rulesets)_

## Interactive Demonstrations
- [Universal String Enumeration | Wolfram Demonstrations Project](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/UniversalStringEnumeration/)
    _(allows experimentation with the enumeration of all strings, which was the first step toward a ruleset enumeration)_
- [Tree of Strings | Wolfram Demonstrations Project](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TreeOfStrings/)
    _(another way to interact with the enumeration of all strings, interpreting the binary coding as a binary tree in the case of strings -- base-3 encoding and a ternary tree for string lists)_
- [Calkin-Wilf Tree of Fractions | Wolfram Demonstrations Project](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/CalkinWilfTreeOfFractions/)
    _(a bijective enumeration of all rational numbers shown in a binary tree, part of the inspiration for our enumerations)_
