# FAQs

Presently, the most frequently asked questions can be answered here on this website, on the [official collection of introductory Mathematica Notebooks/PDFs](https://sessieresearchatsau.github.io/faq/index.html), and on the [introductory GitHub repo](https://github.com/sessieresearchatsau/Intro-Documents). As of a yet, a simple and concise FAQs page has not been developed. In an ongoing effort to consolidate these resources, however, this page (along with sub-pages) will be populated with concise answers and links to more detailed notebooks/PDFs/docs.

> Ongoing TODO: A table of FAQs goes here.
