# Mathematica
Mathematica is a powerful computational platform/software developed by Wolfram Research, designed for technical computing across mathematics, science, engineering, and beyond.  At its core is the **Wolfram Language**, a symbolic, functional programming language that enables everything from solving equations to building dynamic visualizations. Mathematica’s **notebook interface** blends code, text, graphics, and interactive elements into a single, elegant environment—ideal for research, education, and technical documentation. It also supports cloud deployment, real-time interactivity, and integration with other languages like Python. For a deeper dive, check out [Wolfram Notebooks](https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/), the [Notebook Basics guide](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/NotebookBasics.html), and the [Wolfram Language introduction](https://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/IntroductionOverview.html).

We need to use **Mathematica** because it’s the only platform that can run the Wolfram Language code used in the SSS research project. The code relies on built-in functions and symbolic rules that only work inside Mathematica’s environment. Installing it gives you access to the notebook editor, powerful visualization tools, and the full symbolic engine needed to explore and simulate substitution systems. Without it, the code simply won’t run.

## Setting Up
#### Local Installation (Preferred)
1. Grab the official installer: [Wolfram Download Center](https://www.wolfram.com/download-center/)
2. The installer will first download the program and local documentation. This is a large download, so it may take some time. It may also ask where you want to download this content, using the any folder is fine as it may be deleted after installation is complete.
3. Once installed, you may be prompted to activate the software. In order to do so:
	1. Click "Other ways to activate"
	2. Select "Activate through a Wolfram network license server"
	3. Enter Southern's Mathematica server name `mathematica.southern.edu`
	4. Our license allows Mathematica to be installed on any computer owned by Southern or by any student, faculty/staff member. Once you have input our license server address the first time, you should be able to just hit to (occasionally) reconnect. Usually reconnection is automatic. Please let me know if you have any difficulties. Connection required you to be connected to the Southern.edu Wi-Fi network or via an Southern VPN.

#### Cloud Activation (Alternative)
If you don’t have enough disk space for Mathematica, you may use a Wolfram Cloud account to run Mathematica in the Cloud from a memory-poor or storage-space-poor device.
1. Go to https://www.wolframcloud.com/, and/or or get the app: https://www.wolfram.com/cloud app.
2. Log in with your southern.edu email address.
3. At least ONE TIME, go to https://user.wolfram.com/, log in using your southern.edu email address, and complete the registration form, indicating student status and expected graduation date. Submit the form.
4. When you go back to Wolfram Cloud, after perhaps a short delay, you should see that "Plan: BASIC" in the middle of the top menu bar has changed to "Plan: Southern Adventist University". This allows you to drag and drop files from your computer to/from your Wolfram Cloud folders.
5. Note that this will be much slower than having a local installation. We only have 25 licenses, so students using iPads in classes where Mathematica is used will have priority. **Local installation is preferred**.

## Tips for Getting Started
> **Watch Video**: [Hands-on Start to Mathematica: Wolfram U Class](https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/courses/wolfram-language/hands-on-start-to-mathematica-wl005/)

A few tips for getting started:
- After typing "=", type in English what you want to do. Learn from Mathematica how to use Mathematica!
- Use `<Shift>-<Enter>` to execute commands.
- Click any word and hit `<f1>` to get specific help on that topic, format of commands, live examples.
- Common tasks: graphing (Plot, Plot3D, ContourPlot), solving equations & systems of equations (Solve), taking the derivative or integral (D, Integrate).
