## Clocking In and Out with Clockify

Use [Clockify](https://clockify.me/) to log your hours accurately and transparently. Clockify is not meant to replace southern's current time tracking solution, only to add additional insights into how you are using your time. It also makes it easier for your supervisor to keep track of your work hours. Please download the browser extension for the most efficient use.

### How to Log Time

- **Clock In** when you begin work.
- **Clock Out** when you stop—don’t leave timers running!
- **Specify Your Task**:
  - Use clear, descriptive labels like:
    - `Documentation – Glossary Update`
    - `Graph Visualization – PyVis Integration`
    - `Team Meeting – Weekly Sync`
    - `Research – Rule Enumeration`

### Tips

- Log time **daily** to avoid forgetting details.
- Use **tags or projects** to group related work.
- If you forgot to clock in, please enter it on clockify and then ask your supervisor to enter your hours manually.
