# ðŸ”‘ Managing Teams (for Administrators)

The page includes basic steps and links to official documentation for managing teams, roles, and organization-wide member permissions. While not comprehensive, enough information is provided to adequately get started in managing members and their corresponding teams.

> All steps shown below are starting from the main Organization GitHub Page.

## Setting Orginization-wide Base Member Permissions
Anyone who becomes a member automatically inherits some permission to the organization, even before being added to a Team. This is why it is important to set base permissions that you are fine with all members inheriting. To do so, 
<kbd>Settings âžž Member privileges âžž [set base permission to either "read" or "None"]</kbd>

You can also step through the `Member privileges` page and fine-tune the other base settings to your liking.

## Assigning different permissions to specific Teams
To assign more permissive permissions to specific teams (that members will then inherit):<br>
<kbd>Settings âžž Organization roles âžž Role assignments âžž New role assignment âžž [select a permission level and search for a team (or member)] âžž follow remaining prompts</kbd>

To manage existing roles, simply use the same page. To give higher privileges for a specific repository to a particular Team:
<kbd>Teams âžž [select team] âžž Repositories âžž Add repository</kbd>

## Moving Members Between Teams

While GitHub does not offer a simple way to "drag-drop" members between Teams, it does make it easy to remove and add members. In this way members can be organized into Teams. It is by being part of a Team that any particular member inherits read/write/maintain/admin permissions. Thus, it is crucial that teams are properly managed for decent project security and member cohesion.

To **add a member**:
<kbd>Teams âžž [click on a team] âžž Add a member âžž [search for name] âžž follow remaining prompts</kbd>

To **remove a member**:
<kbd>Teams âžž [click on a team] âžž [click on checkbox next to the member's profile] âžž Remove from team [in the dropdown above the checkboxes]</kbd>

## Making trusted members full Owners

Admin permissions, although permissive, are not as permissive as the privileges gained by being a full-fledged owner. To add a member as an owner with full control of the Organizations GitHub Account:
<kbd>People âžž [select member] âžž [dropdown under profile] âžž set as "Owner"</kbd>

This, of course, can be reversed at anytime.
